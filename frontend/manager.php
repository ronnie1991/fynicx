                    <p style="padding: 15px;text-align: justify;font-size: 17px;line-height: 29px;">The roots of Modern education system in India can be traced back to the ancient Guru Kula tradition where both students and mentors used to live together as equals irrespective of their social standing. Today, in this era of fast cars and social networks, we have actually lost many of our traditional values and ethics, still while it comes down to education a few schools of our country are trying their best to uphold the Guru- sishya relationship in quite an accommodative way. While there are many schools in our country, yet, in regards of proper education we are still considered backward and branded by many renowned educationalists of the 21st century as “lagged behind with obsolete materials to read”.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;font-size: 17px;line-height: 29px;">Every parent wishes for his/her child to have the best school environment, teachers, so that the child grows up to be educated and successful in life. A.G.P.N., Purulia values your wishes and gladly assures you to keep all the promises. We provide a natural environment away from the din and bustle, clamour and turmoil of the city and embrace a peaceful surrounding. All the courses provided here are positively beneficial to the students which will push their latent talent. All the primitive courses which is there from the time immemorial like Mathematics, Language, History and Science etc. have been completely overhauled, thanks to the new syllabus provided by the CBSE which are sure to make their knowledge practical and just. Along with studies, we’ve looked after physical activities and self-defence with utmost humility and these courses are mandatory which will help the students to stay mentally focused and physically fit. Besides the rudimental courses, we also take care of your child’s creativity and imagination and provide courses like Computer, Music and Drawing, tutelage by our expert teachers. With education comes proper evaluation to determine who is keeping up with the course and who is losing the pace. During the classroom sessions topics are covered vigorously, doubt clearings and class tests are initiated at regular intervals; for examination we thoroughly follow the CBSE pattern. The Morning prayer, followed by speeches/ inspirational thoughts are organised to maintain a calm and serene concentration power throughout the day and thus we rejuvenate and incorporate the traditional Vedic ways of education and preserve our heritage. </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;font-size: 17px;line-height: 29px;">Pedagogy is something that is built up on a number of promises and mutual trust. We’ve taken a step towards juxtaposing values and tradition with practical and modern education and invite you with open arms to join us. The purpose of education is to impart knowledge that will enhance the pupils’ power of understanding and perception but ‘knowledge’ is slowly becoming a condensed and transient Haiku; shackled, owing to the communication gap between preceptors and learners; for this, we have taken a leap to eradicate these gaps between the two ends and built a cordial environment. A.G.P.N. values the individual talents of its each and every pupil and at the same time commemorates the great tradition. As T.S. Eliot said, “the historical sense involves a perception, not only of the past but of its presence”, we uphold these codes exponentially. Our teachers are always here to show your child the right path, all they need is to hold our hand.</p>
