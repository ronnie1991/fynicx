                    <p style="padding: 15px;text-align: justify;font-size: 17px;line-height: 29px;">A large number of residential schools exist in our country and many new schools are coming up every year. All the residential schools are trying their best to give quality education. The School education in India is undergoing a complete transformation. Due to the changing of the lifestyle of the society, increased work pressure in the office, nuclear family structure and many other similar factors, the parents always remain under a lot of pressure and fail to devote required amount of time for their wards. Instead of providing the right kind of attention, time and care for the holistic development of their children, the parents provide them with all kinds of luxury to show their love and thereby make their words crippled and physically unfit. The children of today get very less time and scope for sports and games. The parents concentrate their attention mostly for the academic improvement of their wards and neglect the other important aspects of education which helped the children to in-calculate moral, ethical and spiritual values.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;font-size: 17px;line-height: 29px;">Realizing the importance of these values AGPN SCHOOLS have been set up at the sacred and serene confluence of river Kansai and peaceful soil of Purulia to take proper care of all the learning needs of the children covering the all the aspect of education. The School is a step towards the revival of our ancient Gurukul system. The children at AGPN SCHOOLS will grow in open air in harmony with nature. They will get ample scope and opportunity for the fullest expression of their hidden talents. The stress free environment of our trained teachers and mentors will help the students develop an impressive personality with right kind of charactor, leadership ability and business acumen. The  educational system and training at AGPN SCHOOLS will find its roots developed in the line with the Vedic values prevalent in ancient Gurukuls. The branches, leaves and flowers of the system will reflect a proper blending of educational ideas and ideology taken from Swami Dayananda Saraswati, Mahatma Gandhi, Sri Aurobindo and Kaviguru Rabindra Nath Tagore. The students at AGPN SCHOOLS will be trained in such a way that they keep their surrounding happy and motivated. The stress free educational environment at AGPN SCHOOLS will build the students as world leaders and high achivers. The investment of parents on their wards at AGPN SCHOOLS will give many fold returns in the years to come and our parents will be proud to have such a school for the holistic development of their wards. </p>
